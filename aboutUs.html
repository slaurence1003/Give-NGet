        <h1>Learn About Our Mission</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to Give 'N Get', a passionate project initiated by six
          determined women on a mission to make a difference. As computer
          science students, we harnessed our technical skills and shared
          commitment to create a platform that connects those in need with vital
          resources. Our website is designed to empower and uplift women facing
          various challenges. We believe in the power of community and support,
          and that's why we've built a space where women can access essential
          resources and find the help they deserve. It also provides opportunity
          to give back to our communities. Together, we're creating a network of
          solidarity and kindness, striving to improve the lives of women in
          need. We hope you join us on this journey!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>&#9829; Sabine, Arielle, Chloe, Natasha, Lauren, and Sarah</p>
